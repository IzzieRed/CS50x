For my final project, I created a "Project Planner" website to help organize and break down projects.
In addition to my own CSS stylesheet, I also used elements from the bootstrap theme "minty" (Copyright 2012-2020 Thomas Park, Licensed under MIT (https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/main/LICENSE) url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Montserrat:wght@400;500;700&display=swap")
To execute this project, I used CSS, Javascript, Python, HTML, Flask, and SQL.
I used 10 HTML pages and implemented over 12 functions using Python.
The Python functions included a login, logout, register, create new project, add tasks, finish tasks, finish project, archive, and more.
Users can save their projects halfway through and return at a later date without forgetting where they left off.
They can also view archived projects, the due dates, and the date they completed the project.
I wrote this project in the CS50 IDE using the built in server. See the video of my project at this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIOdeu2RXWk&t=31s
